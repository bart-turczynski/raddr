# check-bugreports v1
"""BugReports / tracker-link split gate.

WHY THIS EXISTS. CRAN runs two checks over a GitLab `BugReports:` URL and
they contradict each other. `tools::check_url_db()` actually fetches the
address; GitLab moved issue reporting to a new work-items UI, so the classic
`.../-/issues` path 404s for a signed-out client (the exact client CRAN's
check uses) while `.../-/work_items` serves 200. `tools:::.check_package_CRAN_incoming()`
never fetches anything -- it is a hardcoded string test on the path
(`!grepl("/issues(/new)?/?$", z$path)`) that only accepts the `/-/issues`
form and flags anything else, `/-/work_items` included, with a "should
likely be .../issues" NOTE. No URL satisfies both.

Both complaints are NOTEs, neither blocks acceptance, and this is not
hypothetical: the first pslr 1.2.1 upload declared `/-/work_items` in
`DESCRIPTION` and was ARCHIVED at the CRAN pretest on 2026-09-12; the
resubmission with `/-/issues` was accepted (pslr commit 509c776). So the
field the incoming check string-tests keeps the CRAN-safe form, and every
file a HUMAN actually clicks through -- which the incoming check never reads
-- points at the address that is not a dead link. See SEOR-ocbtrrnl.

`man/raddr-package.Rd`'s "Report bugs at" link is not a separate
decision: `R/raddr-package.R` uses roxygen2's `"_PACKAGE"` sentinel,
which generates that "Useful links" section verbatim from `DESCRIPTION`'s
own `URL:`/`BugReports:` fields. It therefore MUST agree with `DESCRIPTION`,
never with the human-facing files, or `devtools::document()` was not re-run.

WHAT IT CHECKS.

1. `DESCRIPTION`'s `BugReports:` is the CRAN-incoming-safe form: it ends in
   `/-/issues`, optionally `/new`, optionally a trailing slash, and does not
   name `/-/work_items`.
2. `man/raddr-package.Rd`'s "Report bugs at" link is IDENTICAL to
   `DESCRIPTION`'s `BugReports:` value.
3. No HUMAN-FACING file below carries a `/-/issues` link:
     - codemeta.json (`"issueTracker"`)
     - SECURITY.md
     - README.Rmd
     - README.md
     - _pkgdown.yml
     - vignettes/*.Rmd
4. The files in REQUIRES_WORK_ITEMS, if present, also NAME `/-/work_items`.

RADDR ADAPTATION (ported from pagerankr, SEOR-ocbtrrnl). pagerankr requires
every human-facing file to name `/-/work_items`. raddr's README.md and
SECURITY.md name no tracker at all (SECURITY.md routes reports privately to
the maintainer), and a link is not invented here just to satisfy a gate. So
for raddr the rule is split in two: a `/-/issues` link is forbidden in every
human-facing file (point 3), and naming `/-/work_items` is required only where
the file exists to name a tracker (point 4): codemeta.json's `issueTracker`,
which raddr does not carry today.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK, ON PURPOSE.

* `NEWS.md` and `cran-comments.md` are point-in-time records of what was
  actually announced or submitted (AGENTS.md: "spec and code disagree ->
  code and ADR win" is about specs, but the same reasoning applies to a
  record of a past submission). A historical bullet or paragraph that quotes
  an old `/-/issues` form, including one arguing FOR that form, is not
  drift, so both files are exempt.
* `codemeta.json`'s `"issueTracker"` is deliberately NOT compared against
  `DESCRIPTION`'s `BugReports:` for equality -- `scripts/check-citation.py`
  does not enforce that either, and after this change the two are SUPPOSED
  to differ (that is the whole point of the split).
* Nothing here touches the network. Whether a URL currently resolves is a
  fact about the rest of the world; `R CMD check --as-cran` already fetches
  declared URLs, and a network call in a pre-push gate fails on a train.

Stdlib only, so it runs in any bare Python CI image, same shape as
`scripts/check-citation.py` (which this file does not import from or
modify -- that script is owned by a separate, fleet-wide dedup decision).
